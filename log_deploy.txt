[11:40:20.888] npm warn deprecated stable@0.1.8: Modern JS already guarantees Array#sort() is a stable sort, so this library is deprecated. See the compatibility table on MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort#browser_compatibility
[11:40:20.890] npm warn deprecated sourcemap-codec@1.4.8: Please use @jridgewell/sourcemap-codec instead

[11:40:21.100] npm warn deprecated rollup-plugin-terser@7.0.2: This package has been deprecated and is no longer maintained. Please use @rollup/plugin-terser
[11:40:21.424] npm warn deprecated q@1.5.1: You or someone you depend on is using Q, the JavaScript Promise library that gave JavaScript developers strong feelings about promises. They can almost certainly migrate to the native JavaScript promise now. Thank you literally everyone for joining me in this bet against the odds. Be excellent to each other.

[11:40:22.652] npm warn deprecated inflight@1.0.6: This module is not supported, and leaks memory. Do not use it. Check out lru-cache if you want a good and tested way to coalesce async requests by a key value, which is much more comprehensive and powerful.

[11:40:34.931] [0;33mOne of your dependencies, babel-preset-react-app, is importing the
[11:40:34.931] "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" package without
[11:40:34.931] declaring it in its dependencies. This is currently working because
[11:40:34.931] "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" is already in your
[11:40:34.931] node_modules folder for unrelated reasons, but it [1mmay break at any time[0;33m.
